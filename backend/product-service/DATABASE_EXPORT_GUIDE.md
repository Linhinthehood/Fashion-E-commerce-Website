# 📦 Database Export/Import Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Created

I've created a complete database export/import system for your Fashion E-commerce website. Here's what you got:

### 📁 Files Created:
1. **`utils/exportDatabase.js`** - Exports database to JSON/CSV
2. **`utils/importDatabase.js`** - Imports data back to database
3. **`utils/viewExport.js`** - Quick view of exported data
4. **`utils/README.md`** - Detailed documentation

### 📊 Export Formats:
- **JSON files** (categories, products, combined)
- **CSV file** (for Excel/Google Sheets)
- **Summary report** (statistics and insights)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Export Database

Navigate to product-service and run:

```bash
cd backend/product-service
npm run export:db
```

**Output:** Creates 5 files in `exports/` folder:
- `categories.json` - All category data
- `products.json` - All product data with category details
- `database-export.json` - Combined data with statistics
- `products.csv` - Products in CSV format
- `export-summary.json` - Summary statistics

### 2️⃣ View Export Summary

```bash
npm run view:export
```

**Output:** Beautiful console display of:
- Total statistics
- Gender distribution
- Top brands
- Products by category
- File sizes

### 3️⃣ Import Database

```bash
# Import (updates existing, adds new)
npm run import:db

# Import and clear all existing data first (⚠️ Destructive!)
npm run import:db:clear
```

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### 📋 Backup Your Data
```bash
npm run export:db
```
Creates a timestamped backup of all your products and categories.

### 📊 Analyze in Excel
Open `exports/products.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets for analysis and reporting.

### 🔄 Clone Database
Export from production, import to development:
```bash
# On production
npm run export:db

# Copy exports folder to development
# On development
npm run import:db
```

### 🧪 Testing
Create test data, export it, and reset when needed:
```bash
# After creating test data
npm run export:db

# Run tests...

# Reset to original state
npm run import:db:clear
```

### 📈 Track Changes Over Time
Export regularly and compare JSON files to see how your catalog evolves.

## 📂 File Locations

All exports are saved to:
```
backend/product-service/exports/
├── categories.json
├── products.json
├── database-export.json
├── products.csv
└── export-summary.json
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 🔴 `import:db:clear` is Destructive!
The `--clear` flag **deletes all existing data** before importing. Use with caution!

```bash
# Safe: Updates existing, adds new
npm run import:db

# Dangerous: Deletes everything first!
npm run import:db:clear
```

### 💾 Always Backup First
Before using `import:db:clear`, always export current data:
```bash
npm run export:db  # Backup
npm run import:db:clear  # Then import
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Export fails with "MongoDB connection error"
- Check `.env` file has correct `MONGODB_URI`
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible

### Import fails with "Export files not found"
- Run `npm run export:db` first to create export files

### Want to export specific data only?
- Edit `utils/exportDatabase.js`
- Add filters to the mongoose queries

### Need different date format in CSV?
- Edit `utils/exportDatabase.js`
- Modify the CSV generation section

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Schedule Regular Backups**: Set up a cron job or task scheduler to run `npm run export:db` daily
2. **Version Control**: Consider committing export files to git for history tracking
3. **Cloud Backup**: Sync the `exports/` folder to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts if export size changes drastically

## 🎯 Summary

You now have a complete database export/import system! Use it to:
- ✅ Backup your data regularly
- ✅ Migrate between environments
- ✅ Analyze data in spreadsheets
- ✅ Create test datasets
